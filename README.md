# Embedded-Project
In my embedded systems projects, I've used various technologies like ADC, SPI, I2C, DMA, timers, GPIO, communication protocols, and RTOS. I've developed user-friendly interfaces with Qt and Linux. These projects, detailed on my GitHub, reflect my versatile skills in creating efficient and reliable embedded systems.
